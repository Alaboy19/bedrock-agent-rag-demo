  DigiD is a crucial digital identification system for expats in the
  Netherlands. Here's what you need to know:  Key Features: • It's an
  electronic identification system used to access government services
  online • Requires a Burger Service Number (BSN) to obtain • Allows
  you to:   - Submit tax returns   - Register address changes   -
  Access digital government communications   - Interact with official
  services and organizations  How to Get DigiD: 1. First, obtain your
  Burger Service Number (BSN) by registering with your local
  municipality 2. Once you have your BSN, you can request a DigiD
  login 3. Download the DigiD app for easy access  Many important
  services now use DigiD, including government offices, insurance
  companies, and health services. Most official correspondence will
  arrive through Mijnoverheid.nl, which you can access using your
  DigiD.
